# Basic Streamlit App 🐧

This is a simple web application built using the Streamlit library. It demonstrates how to create interactive data dashboards with Python code. Using the streamlit library, I constructed different interactive data tables to display the data in [penguins.csv](https://github.com/lweeldre/Weeldreyer-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio%20Update%201/data/penguins.csv). These data tables include pull-down bars, filtering options, bar charts, and scatter plots.

## How to Run the App
1. Ensure you have Streamlit installed: "pip install streamlit"
2. Run the following command: "streamlit run penguins_app/main.py"
